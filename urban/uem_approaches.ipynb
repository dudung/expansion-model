    "Throughout the 1950s and 1970s expansion of cities into their surrounding areas, in the form of suburbanization and ex-urbanization, was following urbanization as first witnessed in the West, which is a constant outwards expansion of urban areas driven traditionally by spatial expansion and accompanied by population growth within the areas [[1](#r01)]. Urban Expansion Model (UEM) is used to forecast heat island intensification globally [[2](#r02)]."
